# junit5-migration-maven-kotlin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/junit-team/junit5-samples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/junit-team/junit5-samples)

The junit5-migration-maven-kotlin project demonstrates how to execute tests written in Java and Kotlin
based on JUnit 5 using Maven. In addition, it showcases that existing JUnit 4 based tests can be executed
in the same test suite as JUnit Jupiter based tests or any other tests supported on the JUnit Platform.

Please note that this project is uses the [Maven Wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper)
3.6.1 version. This helps you ensure that already tested versions are not going to be failed if
locally installed different maven version.
